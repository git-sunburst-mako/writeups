# Executive Summary
## Brief
> _There are two machines on my home network that host projects and stuff I'm working on in my own time -- one of them has a webserver that's port forwarded, so that's your way in if you can find a vulnerability! It's serving a website that's pushed to my git server from my own PC for version control, then cloned to the public facing server. See if you can get into these! My own PC is also on that network, but I doubt you'll be able to get into that as it has protections turned on, doesn't run anything vulnerable, and can't be accessed by the public-facing section of the network. Well, I say PC -- it's technically a repurposed server because I had a spare license lying around, but same difference._

| git-serv | Windows | 10.200.83.150 | internal Git server |
| wreath-pc | Windows | 10.200.83.100 | internal personal computer |

```
