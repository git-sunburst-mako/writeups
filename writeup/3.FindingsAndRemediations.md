# Findings and Remediations

Vulnerabilities are graded in severity according to their CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score, as calculated using CVSS V3.1:

| CVSS Rating | Severity | Desc |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1 - 3.9 | Low | Minimal impact and limited exploitability - e.g: may require physical access to hardware
| 4.0 - 6.9 | Medium | Exploits that provide only limited access, or more significant exploits that dependent upon prior access - e.g: attacker must have user privileges, reside within the target network, or leverage social engineering techniques
| 7.0 - 8.9 | High | Vulnerabilities which can give an attacker elevated access to a system / network or could result in significant downtime or data loss, but which are difficult to explot.
| 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical | Likely results in root-level access for the attacker.  Exploitation does not require any significant prior access or knowledge.
